          These Terms of Use (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your access to and use of the
          WISeReady web application (the &quot;Service&quot;). WISeReady is a proof-of-concept prototype that surfaces current Medicare data and code references to help with WISeR prior-authorization research. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of the Terms, you must not use the Service.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Informational Prototype Only</h3>
        <p>
          WISeReady is an informational tool that references currently available Medicare policy data, code sets, and WISeR program information. It is an early-stage prototype, and the experience, data coverage, and outputs are subject to rapid change. The Service does not provide medical, legal, billing, or compliance advice, and the content is not a substitute for professional judgment.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Data Verification Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
          While the Service draws from current Medicare resources and procedure codes, you remain solely responsible for validating all results against official Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) publications, your Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC), and any other authoritative payer sources before making clinical, billing, operational, or compliance decisions. Do not rely on the Service as your only source of truth.
