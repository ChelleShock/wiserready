# Example env file for local development

# Option 1: Provide a full URL (S3 presigned URL, CDN, etc.) that serves the JSON (optionally gzipped)
# RULES_GROUPED_URL=https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json.gz
# RULES_GROUPED_URL=s3://your-bucket/path/to/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json

# Option 2: Provide bucket + key separately (handy when your platform injects them individually)
# RULES_GROUPED_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
# RULES_GROUPED_S3_KEY=rules/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json
# AWS_REGION=us-east-1

# Option 3: Local file path for development fallback
# RULES_GROUPED_PATH=./data/cms/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json
# (If this default path is missing, the loader falls back to https://cms.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json)
