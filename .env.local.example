# Example env file for local development
# Point to a public URL (S3, GCS, CDN) that serves the rules JSON (optionally gzipped)
# e.g.
RULES_GROUPED_URL=https://your-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json.gz

# If you prefer a local path (dev), you can use RULES_GROUPED_PATH instead:
# RULES_GROUPED_PATH=./data/cms/rules_grouped_by_cpt.json
