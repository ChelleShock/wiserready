The only exception would be the global billing (professional/technical components [PC/TC]) of HST by an office-based physician who meets the requirements under the Physician Training/Certification as noted in the LCD. In this case, the PC/TC for HST can be covered for the purpose of testing a patient for the diagnosis of OSA if the home sleep testing is reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis of the patient&rsquo;s condition as outlined in the LCD; and the office-based technician doing the patient instruction and HST scoring meet the training/credentialing requirements as outlined in the LCD. Under this circumstance, the physician would be the interpreter of the test and bill globally. In all other circumstances, the physician who is providing the PC of the HST must be identified specifically in the medical record as the interpreter of the test. It should be noted that per the related LCD, the laboratory physician must review the entire raw data recording for every patient studied. Raw data refers to data obtained directly from patient output to the acquisition device. All channels to and from the acquisition device must be physical channels and not derived, calculated, virtualized, or created by software to create channels for the purposes of the test and scoring of the raw data, i.e., a respiratory channel must be a physical channel to and from the acquisition device for the purpose of the test and scoring/analysis of the data. All raw/autoscored data must be scored/re-scored by an individual certified by the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists as a Registered Polysomnographic Technologist (RPSGT), or equivalent, or by a polysomnographic technician under the supervision of a RPSGT, or equivalent, manually even if an autoscoring protocol is applied prior to manual scoring/analysis. The name of the scoring RPSGT, supervised polysomnographic technologist, or equivalent, as well as an indication the procedure was manually scored/analyzed must be on the scoring report or interpretation report indicating &ldquo;manually scored/analyzed&rdquo;.
